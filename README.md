#Work in progress. This will manage network configuration for hosting platforms

#Ideally this will work on most machines/distros.

#Currently working with Netplan on ubuntu, but will integrate further as dev comes along.

#todo: add compatibility with other network services like nm

#      auto detect running OS
#      save pre-genned configs
